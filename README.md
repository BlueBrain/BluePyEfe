Introduction
============

BluePyEfe aims at easing the process of reading experimental recordings and extracting 
batches of electrical features from these recordings. To do so, it combines
 trace reading
functions and features extraction functions from the [eFel library](https://github.com/BlueBrain/eFEL).

BluePyEfe outputs protocols and features files in the format used
by [BluePyOpt](https://github.com/BlueBrain/BluePyOpt) for neuron electrical
 model building.
